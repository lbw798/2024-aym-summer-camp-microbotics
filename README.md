4 Day Robotics Course for 2024 AYM Pittsburgh Middle School Summer Camp

## Arduino Robotics for Middle Schoolers: Welcome! 

This is your guide to the exciting world of robotics using Arduino microcontrollers! Get ready to build, code, and explore the world of electronics and robotics with fun, hands-on projects. 

**What will you learn?**

* The basics of electronics: We'll explore concepts like voltage, current, and circuits to understand how robots work.
* Introduction to Arduino: You'll learn how to use the Arduino Uno board, a powerful tool for controlling robots.
* Coding with Arduino: We'll use a beginner-friendly programming language called Arduino C++ to write code and give your robots instructions.
* Building robots: You'll put your newfound knowledge to the test by building cool robots that can move, light up, and interact with the world!

**What will you need?**

* **Arduino Uno Starter Kit:** This kit includes an Arduino Uno board, various sensors (like LEDs, buttons, and ultrasonic sensors), jumper wires, a breadboard, and other components you'll need to build your robots. 
* **Computer with internet access:** You'll need a computer to use the Arduino software and code your projects.
* **Enthusiasm and creativity!** This course is all about learning by doing and having fun while you're at it.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Install the Arduino software:**
  1.a. Follow [Arduino Create Agent](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360014869820-Install-the-Arduino-Create-Agent) instructions to download the necessary Arduino plugin to code
  1.b. Go to [Arduino Cloud Editor](https://app.arduino.cc/) where you can create sketches (Arduino code files)
2. **Follow along with this course:** We'll have a series of projects designed specifically for middle schoolers, with clear instructions and step-by-step guides. 

**Safety:**

* Always be careful while working with electronics. 
* Avoid touching components while the circuit is powered on.
* Let a TA or the instructor know if you have any questions or concerns.

**Let's get building!**

This course is designed to be a fun and engaging introduction to robotics for middle schoolers. We'll cover the essential concepts in an easy-to-understand way, so you can create amazing robots in no time. 

**Remember, there are no mistakes in learning, only opportunities to experiment and grow!**

**Happy Tinkering!**
